# BotCheck

> Check if AI crawlers can see your website — or if your blocks are actually working.

BotCheck is a free, open-source tool that scans any URL and reports how visible it is to AI crawlers. No login, no account, no tracking.

## How it works

Paste a URL, pick a goal (Block AI or Be Found by AI), and get a scored report across 7 checks:

- robots.txt analysis against 30+ known AI crawlers
- Meta directives (noai, noimageai, noindex)
- HTTP headers (X-Robots-Tag, Cache-Control, CORS)
- llms.txt presence and validity
- Response stability and latency
- Paywall and login wall detection
- Content structure and semantic HTML quality

Results are scored 0-100 with fully transparent, public scoring weights.

## Principles

- No login, no account, ever
- No data stored or retained
- Transparent scoring algorithm
- Community maintained
- Always free
